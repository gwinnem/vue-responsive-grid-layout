## What is vue-ts-responsive-grid-layout

VUE 3 responsive grid layout is based on the original work by [JBaysolution's vue-grid-layout](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout).

This new and refactored component has more features, typesafe Emits, Props and a strict linting rule setup.

A proper App developed for testing purposes.

Documentation website contains 13 examples. Will be updated when new features are added to the component.
